            <h2 class="painting"> <em>Sunflowers</em> </h2>
            <h2> <em>Vincent van Gogh</em> </h2>
            <p> The earlier series executed in Paris in 1887 gives the flowers lying on the ground,
                while the second set executed a year later in Arles shows bouquets of
                sunflowers in a vase. In the artist\'s mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul
                Gauguin,
                who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later Van Gogh hoped to welcome and to
                impress
                Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted décoration he prepared for the guestroom of his
                Yellow House where Gauguin was supposed to stay in Arles. After Gauguin\'s departure, Van Gogh imagined
                the
                two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and finally he included them in his exhibit at Les
                XX
                in Bruxelles.', 1888, 'Post-Impressionism', 92, 73, 340, 895, 1, NULL, '2016-02-24 12:49:00'),

                Gallery in London in 1877. It is the last of the London Nocturnes and is now widely acknowledged to be
