        <h3> <em>Sunflowers</em> </h3>
        <h3> <em>Vincent van Gogh</em> </h3>
        <p> The earlier series executed in Paris in 1887
            gives the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set executed a year later in Arles shows bouquets of
            sunflowers in a vase. In the artist\'s mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin,
            who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later Van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress
            Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted décoration he prepared for the guestroom of his
            Yellow House where Gauguin was supposed to stay in Arles. After Gauguin\'s departure, Van Gogh imagined the
            two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and finally he included them in his exhibit at Les XX
            in Bruxelles.', 1888, 'Post-Impressionism', 92, 73, 340, 895, 1, NULL, '2016-02-24 12:49:00'),</p>
